* Randomize the order with the "Click to Randomize Order" button
* Quickly jump to the bottom or top of the page via quick jump buttons
* Suggest or report a website via Google Forms links

## Other Cool Stuff üòé

* There's a pretty slick transition when you click the "SHOW MORE" button
* The "bubbles" in the bakground have randomly generated positioning, colour, size and opacity that resets on reload or after various user actions
* The dynamic nature of the "table" is due to the fact that every row is simply a div that uses the CSS grid display property to look like a regular HTML table


## Potential Future Changes‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì

* Framework overhaul: I would want to see how I could improve BoredBubble by using React and some other small UI libraries
* Replacing "table" with a visual "catalog"": I've experimented with automatically generated website preview thumbnails in the past and it didn't work great, but I still think a visual catalog of sorts would be better than the current table
* User accounts... a little far-fetched but would allow for favouriting and saving as well as easier user suggestions and reports
* BoredBubble articles: Website SEO is horrible right now and having a bunch of separate pages with writeups would help tremendously  

Realistically, much of the above will never be done my me, I have move on to other projects. Any open-source contributors wanting to work on BoredBubble can feel free to reach out ü§°
